# AI-Powered Code Assistant

This project is an AI-powered code assistant that leverages various AI models and APIs to help developers with coding tasks, code generation, and potentially code analysis.

## Project Overview

This codebase appears to be set up for a Python-based application that integrates with several AI services, including:

- Groq API
- OpenAI API
- Pinecone (vector database)

The project likely aims to provide intelligent code assistance, potentially including features such as:

- Code generation
- Code completion
- Code analysis
- Natural language processing for code-related queries

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv .env
   source .env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up your environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
   ```

5. Make sure you have the necessary permissions and access to the APIs mentioned in the `.env` file.

6. Run the main application file (the exact filename is not provided in the context, but it's likely a Python file in the root directory).

## Project Structure

- `.env`: Contains environment variables and API keys (not tracked by git)
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories that should not be tracked by git
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies for the project
